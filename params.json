Your domain needs to be hosted Route53. It has WPF user interface and a Windows Service component that perform the same task. WPF application can be started at system startup as well. \r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n\r\nThe project has a WPF user interface and a Windows service. Both are using the same library (DynDns53.Core) so the functionality is the same. Using the user interface is pretty straightforward.     \r\n\r\n![](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/vpblogimg/2015/08/dyndns53-mainwindow.png)\r\n\r\nJust add your AWS keys that have access privileges to your domains. You can set it to run at system start so you don't have to start it manually.\r\n\r\n![](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/vpblogimg/2015/08/dyndns53-seetings-window.png)\r\n\r\n \r\nI built the Windows service using Topshelf. To install it, build the application and on an elevated command prompt just run\r\n\r\n```\r\nDynDns53.Service.exe install\r\n``` \r\n\r\nSimilarly to uninstall:\r\n\r\n```\r\nDynDns53.Service.exe uninstall\r\n``` \r\n","google":"UA-66051201-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
